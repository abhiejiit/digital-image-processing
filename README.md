# digital-image-processing
This is a collection of induvidual matlab files with a '.m' extension that represents each baseline concepts involved in a digital image processing.
I've created various sub branches that contains different sections of the concepts i've learned. These sections include segments like:
  - Histogram Equilisation
  - Noise profiles
  - Segmentation
  - Edge Detection
  - Smoothing (spatial domain)
  - frequency domain
  - Arithmetic operations
  - affine transformations

Explore these files and feel free to change the image path to your custom image. Make sure the images you refer to are of grey scale (monochromatic image).
These files and the imaplementation gives a visual representation and an overview of the concepts.
